First you break down Matrices A and B into Tables with the following Schema:

           A                                                       B
  ----------------------                and              ----------------------
| row  | column  | value |                             | row  | column  | value |


Then you execute the following SQL query to perform Matrix Multiplication:

SELECT A.row, B.column, sum(A.value * B.value)
FROM A JOIN B ON A.column = B.row
GROUP BY A.row, B.column


The result is also of the form:

           C        
  ----------------------  
| row  | column  | value |    


Then you can either unpack table C into Matrix C, or leave it there for further analysis.
